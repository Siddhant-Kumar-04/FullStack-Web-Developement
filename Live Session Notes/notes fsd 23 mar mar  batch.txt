Web Development -> 
    1. Frontend Developement 
    2. Backend Developemnt 

    Frontend -> user facing portion -> uses sessions

    Frontend -> 
        html
        css 
        js 

        Frontend -> It is an interface through which our end users can interact with myh website

    Backend -> 
        Logic driven -> 
        Majorly handles the data -> 
        Generic user never sees that portion -> 
        a generic user cannot interact with that portion 

    Technologies -> criss cross you cna have various ways to learn backend -> 
        1. Programming language
        2. Database 

        JS / Node backend developer
        MongoDb/ Mongoose

    Conclusion -> 
        Frontend vs Backend -> 
    
    Frontend and Backend -> 
        HTMl -> CSS ->GIT ->  JS -> JS DOM -> JS advance -> Tailwind -> React -> Node -> Express
        -> Mongodb -> Mongoose -> Node advance 

        Bootstrap is used much less in comparsion to the up and ocming technology like tailwind -> 

        Bootstrap -> 8-9 years -> 
        Bootstrap -> First popular -> Ui libraries 


        JS is the most popualr -> the most hiring -> 

    
    Frontend -> 5 mins break -> Building Blocks of website

    HTMl -> Strucute of website -> general placement and content putting

    CSS -> Design and beautify

    JS -> functioanlity, click, getting a pop up -> interactivity
